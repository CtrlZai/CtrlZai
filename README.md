✦ An ambitious and motivated individual interested in Cybersecurity and Education ✦

☞ Career Progression

Having spent over six years as a teacher in which I was captivated by the industry
immediately, I successfully did a career change to pursue a challenging career that mix everything that I love education and Cybersecurity. 
As such, I am now working supporting others to start their Cyber Security career.

✐ Areas of Expertise

My focal qualities include analysing and strategising to support all daily operations,
including all aspects of ensuring legality and meeting performance targets monthly.
Furthermore, I utilise intense organisation and relevant IT software to ensure all workflow
is completed without error and can prepare reports and other documentation swiftly,
accurately and to a high standard.
As a person, I am very sociable, naturally calming, and approachable. I possess the necessary
organisational skills, can concisely think in critical moments, and hold strong written and
oral communication. Those personal skills have been essential in me being able to convey
complex information understandably whilst being empathetic to certain situations.

★ Ambition

I am an ambitious and motivated individual that has a desire to keep learning, especially in the area of 
Cybersecurity. Similarly, a chance for career development is a necessity as I aspire to
pursue a prolonged career, as noted by my pursuit of continual career growth. To find out more, connect with me or send me a message.
